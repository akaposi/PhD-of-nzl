\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
In mathematics, quotient represents the result of division. Usually, the division is between numbers and the result can be expressed by a number too. However, the abstract notion of the result of division can be extended to some other domains. Generally speaking, the result of dividing one object by a fixed rule about this object is quotient. In set theory, like addition and multiplication, we also have division of sets by the some equivalence  relations on these sets, and the result sets are called quotient sets.

In Intensional Type Theory\cite{nor:90}, there are no quotient types which represent new types constructed by  dividing certain types by their equivalence relations. However, many efforts has been spent on extend Intensional Type Theory to new quotient types, for example,  creating new type formers\cite{}........

However, without extending ITT, we can still define some quotient sets \cite{aan:2011}. For instances in \cite{nuo:2010}, the normal form integers reducible rational numbers are not actually constructed by from but are related to some setoids, so that we can treat them as the quotient types. The advantage of this is we can flexibly define functions by lifting. The disadvantage of this is we have to manually construct the quotient structure between the setoid $(A,\sim)$ and the quotient type Q, and define functions by lifting rather than automatically generating.

Even we have to  \emph{define} a quotient type then related it with the dividend type, we could get a lot of simplicity when defining functions and proving propositions which the corresponding proposition for dividend type has been proved.

Usually a definable quotient type is defined based on its normal form which can only be equated by identity. Hence types like real numbers $\R$ which do not have their own normal forms are not definable even set theoretically speaking  $\R$  can be seen as the  quotient set of the cauchy sequences of rational numbers  $\Q$.
