1. Revise all the code, proving using simpler way which increase effciency a lot.
2. Add some new properties.
3. Reorganise the structure of files.
4. using some comprehensive symbols.
5. using quotient definition for integers and thinking of define normal form of rational numbers.

Goal: to show that the reals are a field.

ideally one would like to show that they are a "Real closed field"
this is too hard, but show that there is a solution to x^2 - 2 = 0.

Algebraically closed field (like the complex numbers).
