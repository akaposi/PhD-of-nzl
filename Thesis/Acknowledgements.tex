The first person I would like to thank is my supervisor Thorsten Altenkirch. He offered my a great internship on encoding numbers in Agda which finally has been developed into this project. He has always been patient in explaining my questions and taught me a lot on research.
My second supervisor Thomas Anberr√©e is the one who first introduced me functional programming. He has given me a lot precious advises on my project.
I would also like to thank Venanzio Capretta who examined my first and second year report and provided helpful feedbacks.

My friends Nicolai Kraus, Ambrus Kaposi, Christian Sattler, Paulo Caprotti, Florent Balestrieri, Gabe Dijkstra, Neil Sculthorpe and all other PhD students in our lab has helped me a lot in my project by either teaching me mathematics, discussing on research topics and playing badminton to exercise our bodies. The Functional programming lab is really a lively family and I would like to thank everyone here.
Without their generous help, the thesis would not have been finished.


I would also like to thank the organizers and
other participants of the special year on homotopy type theory at the
Institute for Advanced Study where they had many interesting
discussion topics related to part of work, especially Guillaume
Brunerie whose proposal made it possible. Nordvall Forsberg also provided important discussions on our work.

During the years in Nottingham, My mother Guangfei Lv, and my father Youyuan Li continuously support me from China, talk to me and send me my favourite foods. My aunt Guangshu Lv also helps me a lot, gives me advices by sending mails from Germany. Without their support I would never achieve my goals.

Finally, I would like to thank the School of Computer Science and international office in the University of Nottingham who financially support this project.
