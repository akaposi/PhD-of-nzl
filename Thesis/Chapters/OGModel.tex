It is possible to
define the quotient types in Homotopy Type Theory but to implement the
Homotopy Type Theory in \itt{}, it is still a difficult problem. We
work on defining semi-simplicial types and \wog{} to solve it. 



In this chapter we present an syntactic implementation of \wog{} following
Brunerie's approach. We did some contributions like adapting using
heterogeneous equality and syntactic construction of reflexivity.
