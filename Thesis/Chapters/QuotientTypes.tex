\chapter{Quotient Types}
\label{qt}

\fxnote{should say
  something of computer science first rather than mathematics maybe,
  because it is a computer science PhD}

Quotient types is an important part in dependently-typed programming
languages. It makes some type much easier to define and for some other
types possibly to define. Also there are
a set of quotient properties such that we can lift functions from the
base types. I will start to introduce the quotients from mathematical
quotients to quotients in programmming languages to give you an
overview what quotient types are.

\section{Quotients in Mathematics}

\todo{moving the categorical intuition earlier, because it essentially
  generalises the quotients in different topics of
  mathematics. Quotient sets, quotient groups are just instances and
  quotient types should also de derviable from that, and it is much
  easiler to understand. (and ask Paulo about it?)}


% "M"athematics must be capital

Quotient is a basic notion in mathematics. Usually the first
quotient we learn is the result of division. $8 \div 4$ (or $8 / 4$)
gives the result 2 which is called quotient.

At first most mathematicians are only interested in numbers. As long
as they start working on other mathematical objects, some more
abstract structures, many notions are extended. As a simple case, the
product of numbers is extended to the product of vectors and the
product of sets. 

Similarly, quotient is also extended to other objects, for example the
quotient in set theory.

\subsection{Example : quotient sets}
In set theory, we have a similar operation which turns some set
into another set but the divisor is not the same kind of object as the
dividend. We use equivalence relation to divide a set,

\begin{definition}

Equivalence relation. An equivalence relation is a binary
relation which is refleixive, symmetric and transitive.

\end{definition}

Intuitively, given any equivalence relation a set is partitioned into
some cells, so that the elements equivalent to each other are in the
same cell. The cells are called equivalence classes.

\begin{definition}

Equivalence class.

\begin{equation}
[ a ] = \{x : A \;| \; a \sim x \}
\end{equation}

\end{definition}

The set of these equivalence classes is called
the quotient set.

\begin{definition}

Quotient set. Given a set A equipped with an equivalence relation $\sim$, a quotient
set is denoted as $\qset{A}$ which contains the set of equivalence
classes.

\begin{equation}
\qset{A} = \{ [ a ] \;|\; a : A \}
\end{equation}

\end{definition}

Not only in set theory, the quotient of some algebraic structures is
a common notions in other branches of mathematics. The notion of
equivalence relation is extended to spaces, groups, categories and so
does the quotient derived using the same construction. 

Generally
speaking, it describes the collection of equivalent classes of some equivalent relation on sets, spaces or other abstract structures. In type theory, following similar procedure, quotient type is also a conceivable notion.

\subsection{Quotient types in \ett}

In extensional type theory like NuPrl, it is possible to redefine
equality type of some types. However there is also some problems about it:


\subsection{Quotient types in \itt}

%The basic notion in Martin-L¨of’s type theory is the notion of type. A type
%is explained by saying what an object of the type is and what it means for
%two objects of the type to be identical. This means that we can make the
%judgement -- http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/nordstrom.pdf

Quotient types are not available in original \itt{}. Alternatively
we have \emph{setoids} to simulate quotients.

\begin{definition}
\emph{Setoid}. A setoid $(A,\sim)\,\colon\Set_1$ is a set \footnote{Setoid could be universe polymorphic.} 
$A\,\colon\Set$ equipped with an equivalence relation ${\,\sim\,}\colon A \to A \to \Prop$.
\end{definition}

It contains $\AgdaField{Carrier}$ for an underlying set,
$\AgdaField{\_≈\_}$ for a binary relation on $\AgdaField{Carrier}$ and
a proof that it is an equivalence relation.

% and for any $P \colon\,\Prop$, it has
% at most one element, namely we can get proof irrelevance for
% propositions which has type $\Prop$. 
In Agda, we define a setoid as

\begin{code}
\\
\>\AgdaKeyword{record} \AgdaRecord{Setoid} \AgdaSymbol{:} \AgdaPrimitiveType{Set₁} \AgdaKeyword{where}\<%
\\
\>[0]\AgdaIndent{2}{}\<[2]%
\>[2]\AgdaKeyword{field}\<%
\\
\>[2]\AgdaIndent{4}{}\<[4]%
\>[4]\AgdaField{Carrier} \<[22]%
\>[22]\AgdaSymbol{:} \AgdaPrimitiveType{Set}\<%
\\
\>[2]\AgdaIndent{4}{}\<[4]%
\>[4]\AgdaField{\_≈\_} \<[23]%
\>[23]\AgdaSymbol{:} \AgdaBound{Carrier} \AgdaSymbol{→} \AgdaBound{Carrier} \AgdaSymbol{→} \AgdaPrimitiveType{Set}\<%
\\
\>[2]\AgdaIndent{4}{}\<[4]%
\>[4]\AgdaField{isEquivalence} \AgdaSymbol{:} \AgdaRecord{IsEquivalence} \AgdaBound{\_≈\_}\<%
\\
%
\end{code}


We can use setoids to represent quotients, just like the quotient $4$
can be represented as the pair $(8,2)$. However several problems arise
from this approach. 

First of all, originally many operations and types are defined based on
sets, which means that we have to redefine all these types and
operations for setoids because they are different sorts. It is easy to
see if we consider a question: how to represent a quotient if its base
type $A$ is already represented by a setoid. 

Secondly, from a programming perspective, setoids are unsafe because we have access to the underlying
 sets \cite{aan}. The operations on setoids may not respect the
 equivalence relation and make no sense.

Therefore, ideally it is better that the object represent a quotient should also be
of type $\Set$, just as if we divide $8$ by $2$ we prefer $4$ than
$(8,2)$ which makes more sense and can be manipulated uniformly. It is
also the case in the other mathematical theories, the
base object and the quotient object are of the same sort. So how
quotient type should look like in \itt?

Given a setoid $(A,\sim)$, a type $Q : \Set$ can represent the quotient
type of this setoid, if it has several laws:

%In type theory, quotient type can be formalised as following:


\begin{equation*}
\infer[Q-\bf{Form}]{\qset{A} : \Set}{A : \Set & \sim\, : A \rightarrow A \rightarrow \bf{Prop}}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\infer[Q-\bf{Intro}]{[ a ] : \qset{A}}{a : A}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\infer[Q-\bf{elim}]{\hat{f} : (q : Q) \rightarrow B \, q}{
\begin{array}{l}
B : \qset{A} \rightarrow  \bf{Set}\\
f : (a : A) \rightarrow B\, [ a ]\\
(a, b : A)  \rightarrow (p : a \sim b)  \rightarrow f a  \, \stackrel{p}{=} \, f b\\
\end{array}}
\end{equation*}
 
%In general, quotient types are unavailable in \itt.
%Quotients are everywhere, for example, rational numbers, real numbers, multi-sets.

\section{Categorical intuition}


\subsection{split quotient/coequalizer}

Categorically speaking, a quotient is a coequalizer.

\begin{definition}
Coequalizer.
Given two objects $X$ and $Y$ and two parallel morphisms $f, g : \morph{X}{Y}$ , a coequalizer is an object Q with a morphism $q : \morph{Y}{Q}$ such that $q \circ f = q \circ g$. It has to be universal as well. Any pair (Q' , q') $q' \circ f = q' \circ g$ has a unique factorisation u such that $q' = u \circ q$
\end{definition}

\begin{displaymath}
    \xymatrix{X \ar@<0.5ex>[rr]^f \ar@<-0.5ex>[rr]_g && Y \ar[rr]^q
      \ar[ddrr]_{q'} && Q
      \ar@{.>}[dd]^u \\ \\
& &&& Q' }
\end{displaymath}


\begin{displaymath}
    \xymatrix{A \times A \ar@<0.5ex>[rr]^{\pi_1} \ar@<-0.5ex>[rr]_{\pi_2} && A \ar[rr]^{[\cdot]}
      \ar[ddrr]_{q'} && Q
      \ar@{.>}[dd]^u \\ \\
& &&& Q' }
\end{displaymath}



a split quotient is just a split coequalizer, with an embedding
function which finds a representative in each equivalence class.


\subsection{Adjunction between {\textbf{Sets}} and \textbf{Setoids}}

From a higher point of view, Quotient is a Functor which is left-adjoint to $\nabla$ which is the trivial embedding functor from \textbf{Sets} to \textbf{Setoids}.

\begin{definition}

$\nabla A = (A , \equiv)$, $Q (B , \sim) = \qset{B}$

\end{definition}

We have following isomorphism for  the adjunction of the Quotient
Functor and $\nabla$ functor.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\qset{B} & \rightarrow A\\
\midrule
\midrule
(B , \sim) & \rightarrow \nabla A\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}


\section{Impredicative encoding of quotient types}

In set theory, we have the subset relation such that we can construct equivalence
classes and then quotient set. 
However in \itt, the subset types are also unvailable and equivalence
classes cannot be implemented.

The introduction of the univalence axiom for propositions, which is also
called propositional extensionality changes this situation.

\begin{definition}
\emph{propositional extensionality}.

$\forall P, Q : \Prop, (P \iff Q) \iff P = Q.$

\end{definition}

Voevodsky
firsrtly constructs quotients using the following impredicative approach in Homotopy Type Theory using Coq
\cite{voe:hset}.

%The truncation is defined impredicatively.

%\begin{definition}

%$|| A || = (P : \Prop)(A \rightarrow P) \rightarrow P$

%\end{definition}

suppose we have $A : Set$, $\sim : A \rightarrow A \rightarrow Set$.

A quotient type $\qset{A}$ is defined as a predicate and a proof that
it gives rise to an equivalence class and it is non-empty.

$\qset{A} = \Sigma P : A \rightarrow \Prop, EqClass (P) \times (\exists x : A, P (x))$

where the equivalence class proof is encoded as

%$EqClass (P) = (P(a) \times a \sim b \rightarrow P (b)) \times (P(a) \times P(b) \rightarrow a \sim b)$
$EqClass (P) = \forall a, b : A, P(a) \rightarrow (P(b) \iff a \sim b)$

The proof part on the right is the $(-1)-truncation$ such that
different proofs will not gives different terms for the same
equivalence class.


\todo{question of where shall we apply pe}
with the proposional extensionality we can prove that
\begin{theorem}
Given $(P , prf) : \qset{A}$, all proofs of $\exists x : A, P (x)$ are equal
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Given any two proofs of $\exists x : A, P (x)$ written as $(x , px)$ and $(y
, py)$, apply the $EqClass(P)$ to $(x, y, px, py)$ we know that $x
\sim y$. Hence the truncation of 
\end{proof}

%Given a element $a : A$, the equivalence class is

%$ [ x ] = \Sigma y : A, \exists P : X \rightarrow \Prop.


%$$[ x ] = \exists P : X \rightarrow \Prop, \forall a : X, a \sim x \iff P \, a$$


%proposition

%propositional extensionality (univalence)

%impredicative encoding 

%trunction in HoTT

%impredicative encoding 


Moreover we have another suprising theorem:

\begin{theorem}
if we have propositional univalence, we can prove that all
quotients are effective.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose we have a set $A$ with equivalence relation $\sim$.

Given $a : A$, and a predicate $P : A \rightarrow Prop$ defined as 
$$P x = a \sim x$$

With the lifting operator for quotient types,
we have a lifted version of $P$ such that

$$\hat{P} [ x ] =  P x$$

Suppose we have a premise $[ a ] = [ b ]$, it is true that

$$[ a ] = [ b ]$$

and then

$$P a = \hat{P} [ a ] = \hat{P} [ b ] = P b$$

which is just

$$a \sim a = a \sim b$$

with propositional univalence, we know that they are logically equivalent

$$a \sim a \iff a \sim b$$

since $a \sim a$ is the reflexivity which is true trivially,

$$ a \sim b$$ is also true.

Therefore we have a proof that $[ a ] = [ b ] -> a \sim b$ which means
that the quotient is effective.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Functional extensionality and quotient types}

As we have mentioned before, in \itt{} propositional equality $Id(A,a,b)$ is inhabited
if and only if $a$ and $b$ are definitionally equal terms. The Agda
definition could be written as

% \begin{code}

% data Id (A : Set) : A → A → Set where
%   refl : (a : A) → Id A a a

% \end{code}

However the equality of functions are not only judged  by
definitions. Functions are
usually viewed extensionally as black boxes. If two functions pointwise
generate the same outputs for the same inputs, they are equivalent
even though their definitions may differ. This is called
functional extensionality which is not inhabited \cite{alti:lics99} in original
\itt{} and can be expressed as following,

given two types $A$ and $B$, and two functions $f,\,g\,\colon A \to B$,

\[Ext = \forall\, x\colon A, f x = g x \to f = g\]

The problem seems easy to solve by just adding a constant $ext : Ext$
to \itt{} as following codes in Agda

% \begin{code}

% postulate
%   ext : {A : Set}{B : A → Set}{f g : (x : A) → B x}
%         → ((x : A) → Id (B x) (f x) (g x)) 
%         → Id ((x : A) → B x) f g

% \end{code}

However, postulating something could lead to inconsistence. If we
postulate $Ext$, then theory is no longer adequate, which means it is possible to define irreducible terms. 
It can be easily verified in Agda through formalising a non-canonical
term for a natural number by an eliminator of intensional equality. 

Using the eliminator |J| \footnote{It is originally
  used by Martin-L\"{o}f \cite{nor:90} and a good explanation could be
found in \cite{ngk:11}}  of the |Id A a b| :

% \begin{code}

% J : (A : Set)(P : (a b : A) → Id A a b → Set)
%     → ((a : A) → P a a (refl a))
%     → (a b : A)(p : Id A a b) → P a b p
% J A P m .b b (refl .b) = m b

% \end{code}
we can construct an irreducible term of natural number as
% \begin{code}

% irr : ℕ
% irr = J (ℕ → ℕ) (λ f g P → ℕ) (λ f → 0) (λ x → x) (λ x → x) (Ext refl)

% \end{code}

With this term, we can construct irreducible terms of any type $A$ by a
mapping $f : \N \rightarrow A$. This will destroy some good features of \itt
since it could leads to nonterminating programs.

Altenkirch investigates this issue and gives a solution in
\cite{alti:lics99}. He proposes an extension of \itt by a universe of
propositions $\Prop$ in which all proofs of same propositions are
definitionally equal, namely the theory is proof irrelevant. At the same time,
a setoid model where types are interpreted by a type and an equivalence relation acts as the metatheory and $\eta$-rules for
$\Pi$-types and $\Sigma$-types hold in the metatheory. The extended type
theory generated from the metatheory is decidable and adequate, $Ext$ is
inhabited and it permits large elimination (defining a dependent type by recursion). Within this type theory,
introduction of quotient types is straightforward. 
The set of functions are naturally quotient types, the hidden information is the
definition of the functions and the equivalence relation is the
functional extensionality.
% extension

There are more problems concerning quotient types and most
of them are related to equality. One of the main problems is how to lift the functions for
base types to the ones for quotient types. Only functions respecting the
equivalence relation can be lifted. Even in \ett, the implementation
of quotient types does not stop at replacing equality of the types. We
will discuss these in next section.



\section{Example of Quotients}

The introduction of quotient types is very helpful. Many types can be
defined using quotient types, some of them can only be defined with quotient types, such as real
numbers (the reason will be covered in \todo{here}).

\section{literature review}


In \cite{cab}, Mendler et al. have firstly considered building new types from a
given type using a quotient operator $//$. Their work is done in an
implementation of \ett, NuPRL. 

In NuPRL, every type comes with its own equality relation, so the quotient operator can be
seen as a way of redefining equality in a type. But it is not all
about building new types. They also discuss problems that arise from
defining functions on the new type which can be illustrated using a simple example. 

Assume the base type is $A$ and the new equivalence relation is $E$, the new
type can be formed as $A//E$. 

When we want to define a function $f \,\colon\, A//E \to Bool$,  $f\,a \not= f\,b$ may
exists for $a, b \,\colon A$ such that $E\,a\,b$. This will lead to
inconsistency since $E\,a\,b$ implies $a$ converts to $b$ in \ett{}, hence
the left hand side $f\,a$ can be converted to $f\,b$, namely we get $f\,b \not= f\,b$
which is contradicted with the equality reflection rule. 

Therefore a function is said to be well-defined \cite{cab} on the new type only
if it respects the equivalence relation $E$, namely

$$\forall \, a\,b\,\colon A, E\,a\,b \to f\,a = f\,b$$

We call this \emph{soundness} property in \cite{aan}.

 After the introduction of quotient types, Mendler further investigates
 this topic from a categorical perspective in ~\cite{men:90}. He uses
 the correspondence between quotient types in \mltt{} and coequalizers
 in a category of types to define a notion called \emph{squash types},
 which is further discussed by Nogin \cite{nog:02}.

To add quotient types to \mltt{}, Hofmann proposes  three models for
quotient types in his PhD thesis \cite{hof:phd}. The first one is a setoid model for
quotient types. In this model all types are attached with partial
equivalence relations, namely all types are setoids rather than
sets. Types without a specific equivalence relation can be seen as
setoids with the basic intensional equality. This is similar to
\ett{} in some sense. The second one is groupoid model which solves some problems
but it is not definable in \itt{}. He also proposes a third model to
combine the advantages of the first two models, but it also has some
disadvantages. Later in \cite{hof:95:sm} he gives a simple model in which we have type dependency only at the propositional level, he also shows that extensional Type Theory is conservative over \itt  extended with quotient types and a universe \cite{hof:95:con}.

Nogin \cite{nog:02} considers a modular approach to axiomatizing the
same quotient types in NuPRL as well. Despite the ease of constructing new types
from base types, he also discusses some
problems about quotient types. For example, since the equality is
extensional, we cannot recover the
witness of the equality.  He suggests including more axioms to
conceptualise quotients. He decomposes the formalisation of quotient type
into several smaller primitives such that they can be handled much
simpler.

Homeier \cite{hom} axiomatises quotient types in Higher Order Logic
(HOL), which is also a theorem prover. He creates a tool package to
construct quotient types as a conservative extension of HOL such that
users are able to define new types in HOL. Next he defines the
normalisation functions and proves several properties of
these. Finally he discussed the issues when quotienting on the
aggregate types such as lists and pairs.


Courtieu \cite{cou:01} shows an extension of Calculus of Inductive Constructions
with \emph{Normalised Types} which are similar to quotient types, but equivalence relations are replaced by normalisation functions. 
However not all quotient types have normal forms. Normalised types are
proper subsets of quotient types, because we can easily recover a quotient
type from a normalised type as below
%$$ \[ (A, Q, \class\dotph \colon A \to Q) \rightarrow(A, \lambda \,a \,b \to \class a = \class b)\]$$


Barthe and Geuvers \cite{bar:96} also propose a new notion called
\emph{congruence types}, which is also a special class of quotient
types, in which the base type are inductively defined and with a set
of reduction rules called the term-rewriting system. The idea behind
it is the $\beta$-equivalence is replaced by a set of
$\beta$-conversion rules. Congruence types can be treated as an
alternative to the pattern matching introduced in \cite{coq:92}. The main
purpose of introducing congruence types is to solve problems in
term rewriting systems rather than to implement quotient types.


Barthe and Capretta \cite{bar:03} compare different ways to setoids in type theory.
The setoid is classified as partial setoid or total setoid depending
on whether the equality relation is reflexive or not. They also
consider obtain quotients with different kinds of setoids, especially
the ones from partial setoids are difficult to define because the lack
of reflexivity.

Abbott, Altenkirch et al. \cite{abb:04} provides the basis for
programming with quotient datatypes polymorphically based on their
works on containers which are datatypes whose instances are
collections of objects, such as arrays, trees and so on. Generalising
the notion of container, they define quotient containers as the
containers quotiented by a collection of isomorphisms on the positions
within the containers.

Voevodsky \cite{voe:hset} implements quotients in Coq based on a set
of axioms of Homotopy Type Theory. It is based on the groupoid model
for \itt{} where isomorphisms are equalities. He firstly implement
equivalence class and use it to implement quotients which is an
analogy to the construction of quotient sets in set theory.
